GitConfig
=========

My default gitconfig with some fun aliases that help with navigating your git repo and branch completion. 
Keywords: git, gitconfig, lola, lol, navigation, display, completion

## Usage
Simply copy this into some directory (usually your user root). For git
completion, open up the .gitcompletion file and follow comments inside to set it
up (need to edit .bashrc/.profile to run the file).
